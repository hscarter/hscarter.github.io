			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a Masters student studying linalool production in the Arkansas Valley Evening Primrose. I started in fall of 2019 and expect to defend and graduate in spring of 2021. After completing this Masters degree, I intend to pursue a PhD and continue my academic career.</p>
			<p>Before starting this Masters, I moved to Chicago and the Chicago Botanic Garden to be a research assistant for Dr. Krissa Skogen on the <a href="http://onagmoth.org/">Landscapes of Linalool Project</a>. I was moving from Providence RI, where I graduated with a BSc in Biology at Brown University. While at Brown, I completed and defended an honors thesis on the patterns between morphology, phylogeny, and phytochemistry of <em>Viburnum</em> leaves in Mexico with Dr. Erika Edwards. </p>
			<p>I am originally from Wisconsin, where I learned to love the outdoors. When I'm not in the field, lab, or greenhouse, you can find me sailing on Lake Michigan (the very best body of water in the whole wide world).</p>
