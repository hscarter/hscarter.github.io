			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a Masters student studying linalool production in the Arkansas Valley Evening Primrose. I started in fall of 2019 and expect to defend and graduate in spring of 2021. After completing this Masters degree, I intend to pursue a PhD and continue a career as an academic scientist.</p>
			<p>Before starting this Masters, I moved to Chicago and the Chicago Botanic Garden to be a research assistant for Dr. Krissa Skogen on the <a href="http://onagmoth.org/">Landscapes of Linalool Project</a>. Before that I was in Providence, Rhode Island, where I graduated with a BSc in Biology at Brown University. While at Brown, I completed and defended an honors thesis on the patterns between morphology, phylogeny, and phytochemistry of <em>Viburnum</em> leaves in Mexico with Dr. Erika Edwards. </p>
			<p>I am originally from Wisconsin, where I learned to love the outdoors. When I'm not in the field, lab, or greenhouse, you can find me sailing on Lake Michigan (the very best body of water in the whole wide world).</p>
			<p>While I have always had an interest in plants and the natural world, becoming a scientist never felt like an obvious, or even viable, career path until my junior year of college. Because of this experience, increasing the visibility of science as a profession and increasing the diversity of people who can see themselves as scientists is important to me. If my research is interesting to you, and you want to get involved, please reach out! And consider applying for the <a href="https://pbcinternships.org/summer-reu-genes-ecosystems">2020 NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates</a> at the Garden.</p>
